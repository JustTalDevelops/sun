## Explanation
A normal connection is made out to be like this. <br >

Client | Direction | Server
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Drops item |  -> | Processes request
Spawns Item on the ground | <- | Sends back a inventory transaction and AddActor packet

That is known as Peer To Peer. Now we get into the more juicy graphs.

Client | Direction | Proxy | Direction | Server
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Drops item | -> | Forwards request to the server | -> | Processes request
Spawns Item on the ground | <- | Forwards request to the Client | <- | Sends back a inventory transaction and AddActor packet

This is called man in the middle proxying. <br>
It allows for hack clients and custom packets / behavior to work no matter what server you are on. <br>
SunProxy makes use of this for our Custom Transfer and Messaging system!
